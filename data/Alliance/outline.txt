Introduction Missions

    Stranded Merchant to Solaster

        Rescue a merchant captain from a direlect freighter before it explodes, ferry the merchant to Featherweight so that they
        can inform their client of the pirate attack and stolen cargo. Merchant offers <payment> as thanks for saving them, and
        tenatively asks if you could return them home to the Malael system discreetly, informing you that it is a hidden system
        nearby that does not exist on Republic star maps, due to it's status as an Independent system, and their distrust of the
        Republic.
