	description "The Manatee is a new design from Alliance Engineering, this ship design was a proposed progression of the Boxwing Fighter line, to bring it's tried and true principles into a light freighter, however the design was deemed both too costly and lacking in imagination; therefore the engineer left Southbound Shipyards to offer their designs elsewhere, and was quickly taken on by Alliance Engineering. The prototypes offered on the Northern Fringe quickly sold out as word spread of the new ship, and their design was approved for a full production line soon thereafter."

	description "The Baleen is a venerable freighter design that has stood the test of time, it has fallen out of widespread popularity and production due to it's expensive hull and slow speed. Although the Tulkun has been gaining renown as a versatile Heavy Freighter, the Baleen remains the tried and true choice of experienced captains in the Northern Fringe, for although it may be slower and less versatile than more modern designs, it remains a heavily armored titan capable of holding it's own in a fight, and getting it's cargo to it's destination reliably."

Due to the exceptional number of gun ports available on the Krill it is often outfitted with multiple missile pods, giving it lethal first-strike capabilities before engaging opponents at close range."
