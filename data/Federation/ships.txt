	description "The Voidstrider Space Liner schematics and patent were donated to the Alliance of Independent Systems in exchange for the induction of Faerin into the Alliance, since then the Voidstrider has served as a heavy personell and troop transport for the Alliance, with enough armaments to defend itself and support any fleet it is a part of in combat.

	description "The Piranha Drone is a descendant of the Mining Drones which have served as the backbone of mineral extraction fleets in the Northern Fringe for decades. While individually weak, these drones become a force to be reckoned with when deployed as a full squadron. When not deployed in combat these drones still retain limited functionality as mining drones, although not nearly as effecient as their dedicated predecessors."
